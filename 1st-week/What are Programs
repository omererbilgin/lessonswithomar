Computer programs are all bunch of ones and zeros which are translated from human language. 
These "ones and zeros" are all instructions for the computer to do which we're going to
give with human language.

This "human language" I am talking about is actually programming language. Programming languages
gives us the capability of giving orders to the computer without writing ones and zeros. There are 
many programming languages and we are going to learn Scratch.
